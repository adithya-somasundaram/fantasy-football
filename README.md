# fantasy-football

The purpose of this project is to collect weekly fantasy football projections from ESPN, Yahoo, and NFL databases, and project them for the user to see. The program uses BeautifulSoup to webscrape the 3 databases, and displays the information to the user in a Tkinter window. Pending updates based on the status of the 2020 NFL season.
